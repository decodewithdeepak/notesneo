## Objective of the course:
- To understand the different issues involved in the design and implementation of a Neural Networks.
- To study the basic of neural network and its activation functions.
- To understand and use of perceptron and its application in real world.
- To develop an understanding of essential NN concepts such as: learning, feed forward and feed backward.
- To design and build a simple NN model to solve a problem.

> **Note**: Examiner will set nine questions in total. Question one will be compulsory. Question one will have 6 parts of 2.5 marks each from all units and remaining eight questions of 15 marks each to be set by taking two questions from each unit. The students have to attempt five questions in total, first being compulsory and selecting one from each unit.
