## Objective of the course:
- To understand the architecture of web, mining the data, issues, challenges.
- To study the methods of extracting knowledge from web data, text and unusual data.
- To understand and use data mining language like R, Python etc.
- To understand the optimization of web and its applications.

> **Note**: Examiner will set nine questions in total. Question one will be compulsory. Question one will have 6 parts of 2.5 marks each from all units and remaining eight questions of 15 marks each to be set by taking two questions from each unit. The students have to attempt five questions in total, first being compulsory and selecting one from each unit.
