### 4.3 Methods/Techniques of Inventory Control

> PYQ: Explain the following terms with the help of an example: (a) EOQ (b) ABC (c) VED (Jul-21, 15 marks)  
> PYQ: Define Inventory Control. Also explain the various methods of inventory control in detail. (Jul-22, 15 marks)  
> PYQ: Also explain some techniques of inventory control. (May-23, 15 marks)

#### A. Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)

> PYQ: EOQ (Jul-21, 3 marks)

**EOQ** is the optimal order quantity that minimizes total inventory costs (ordering cost + carrying cost).

**Concept:**
- If order quantity is small: Frequent orders → High ordering cost
- If order quantity is large: High inventory → High carrying cost
- EOQ finds the balance

**Formula:**

```
EOQ = √(2 × Annual Demand × Ordering Cost / Carrying Cost per unit per year)
```

**Where:**
- Annual Demand = Total units needed per year
- Ordering Cost = Cost per order (paperwork, transportation, etc.)
- Carrying Cost = Cost to hold one unit in inventory for one year (storage, insurance, etc.)

**Example:**

A company needs 10,000 units per year
- Ordering cost = ₹100 per order
- Carrying cost = ₹5 per unit per year

```
EOQ = √(2 × 10,000 × 100 / 5)
    = √(2,000,000 / 5)
    = √400,000
    = 632 units (approximately)
```

**Meaning:** Company should order 632 units each time to minimize total cost.

**Number of orders per year = 10,000 / 632 = 16 orders**

**Benefits:**
- Minimizes total inventory cost
- Optimal order quantity
- Reduces wastage
- Better planning

#### B. ABC Analysis

**ABC Analysis** classifies inventory items based on their value and importance. It is based on Pareto Principle (80-20 rule).

**Classification:**

**A Category Items (High Value):**
- 10-20% of items
- 70-80% of total value
- Most important items
- Tight control needed
- Frequent review
- Example: Engines in car manufacturing, diamonds in jewelry shop

**B Category Items (Medium Value):**
- 30-40% of items
- 15-20% of total value
- Moderate importance
- Moderate control
- Periodic review
- Example: Tires in car manufacturing, gold in jewelry shop

**C Category Items (Low Value):**
- 40-50% of items
- 5-10% of total value
- Least important
- Simple control
- Annual review
- Example: Nuts and bolts in car manufacturing, packaging material in jewelry shop

**Example:**

A store has 100 items worth ₹10,00,000:

| Category | Items | Value | % Items | % Value |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|---------|
| A | 10 | ₹7,50,000 | 10% | 75% |
| B | 30 | ₹2,00,000 | 30% | 20% |
| C | 60 | ₹50,000 | 60% | 5% |

**Control Measures:**

| Aspect | A Items | B Items | C Items |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Order Frequency** | Frequent | Moderate | Less frequent |
| **Stock Level** | Low | Moderate | High |
| **Safety Stock** | Low | Moderate | High |
| **Review** | Continuous | Monthly | Quarterly |
| **Records** | Detailed | Moderate | Simple |

**Benefits:**
- Focus on important items
- Efficient use of management time
- Reduces inventory cost
- Better control

#### C. VED Analysis

**VED Analysis** classifies items based on their criticality for production.

**Classification:**

**V - Vital Items:**
- Absolutely essential for production
- Production stops without them
- Must always be in stock
- High safety stock
- Example: Engine parts, critical raw materials

**E - Essential Items:**
- Important but not critical
- Production can continue for short time without them
- Moderate stock levels
- Example: Lubricants, some spare parts

**D - Desirable Items:**
- Not critical
- Production can continue without them
- Low stock levels
- Order when needed
- Example: Cleaning materials, stationery

**Example:**

In a manufacturing plant:
- **Vital:** Machine motors (production stops if motor fails)
- **Essential:** Cutting tools (can manage for few days)
- **Desirable:** Paint for final finishing (can delay if needed)

**Control:**
- Vital items: Always maintain stock, high safety stock
- Essential items: Moderate stock, regular review
- Desirable items: Order as needed, low stock

**Benefits:**
- Ensures critical items always available
- Prevents production stoppage
- Optimizes inventory investment

#### D. FIFO (First In First Out)

**FIFO** means materials purchased first are issued first.

**Example:** Perishable items like food, medicines

**Benefits:**
- Prevents obsolescence
- Reduces deterioration
- Suitable for perishable items

#### E. LIFO (Last In First Out)

**LIFO** means materials purchased last are issued first.

**Example:** Non-perishable items like coal, sand

**Benefits:**
- Current prices reflected in cost
- Suitable for non-perishable items

#### F. Just-In-Time (JIT)

**JIT** means receiving materials just when needed for production, maintaining zero or minimal inventory.

**Concept:**
- No storage of materials
- Materials arrive just before use
- Reduces inventory cost to minimum

**Example:** Toyota production system

**Benefits:**
- Minimal inventory investment
- Reduces storage costs
- Less wastage

**Challenges:**
- Requires reliable suppliers
- Risk of production stoppage if supply delayed
- Needs excellent coordination

#### G. Two-Bin System

**Two-Bin System** uses two bins for each item. When first bin empty, order placed and second bin used until new stock arrives.

**Process:**
1. Use materials from Bin 1
2. When Bin 1 empty, place order
3. Use materials from Bin 2
4. When new stock arrives, refill Bin 1
5. Continue using Bin 2

**Benefits:**
- Simple to operate
- Automatic reordering
- Prevents stockouts

**Suitable for:** Low-value items (C category in ABC)

#### H. Reorder Level

**Reorder Level** is the inventory level at which new order should be placed.

**Formula:**
```
Reorder Level = Maximum Consumption × Maximum Lead Time
```

**Example:**
- Maximum daily consumption = 100 units
- Maximum lead time = 10 days
- Reorder Level = 100 × 10 = 1000 units

**Meaning:** When stock reaches 1000 units, place new order.

#### I. Safety Stock (Buffer Stock)

**Safety Stock** is extra inventory maintained to handle uncertainties in demand or supply.

**Purpose:**
- Protect against stockouts
- Handle unexpected demand increase
- Cover supply delays

**Example:** If normal requirement is 1000 units, maintain 1200 units (200 as safety stock)
