## **1. Introduction to Financial Management**

> PYQ: What is financial management and their objective? (Jul-21, 15 marks)  
> PYQ: What is Financial Management? What is the role of financial manager of a company? (Jul-22, 15 marks)  
> PYQ: What is Financial Management? If you are a finance manager, which type of main decisions you will take? (May-23, 15 marks)

### 1.1 Meaning

**Financial Management** is the planning, organizing, directing, and controlling of financial activities such as procurement and utilization of funds in an organization.

**Simple Definition:** Financial management means managing money in a business - how to get money (sources) and how to use it (investment) to maximize profit.

**In Simple Words:** It's like managing your personal finances but for a company - earning money, saving it, spending wisely, and investing for future growth.

**Example:** A startup needs ₹1 crore to expand. Financial management involves:
1. **Deciding how to raise ₹1 crore** (bank loan, investors, or own savings?)
2. **Deciding where to invest** (new machines, marketing, or hiring?)
3. **Managing daily expenses** (salaries, rent, bills)
4. **Planning for profit** distribution (reinvest or pay shareholders?)

### 1.2 Scope

**1. Investment Decisions (Capital Budgeting):**
- Where to invest money for maximum returns
- Example: Should Tata Motors invest ₹500 crore in electric vehicle plant or expand existing factory?

**2. Financing Decisions:**
- How to raise money - debt (loan) or equity (shares)
- Example: Should Flipkart raise ₹1000 crore through bank loan or by selling shares to investors?

**3. Dividend Decisions:**
- How much profit to distribute to shareholders vs retain for growth
- Example: Reliance earned ₹10,000 crore profit - pay ₹4,000 crore as dividend or reinvest all?

**4. Working Capital Management:**
- Managing day-to-day finances (cash, inventory, receivables)
- Example: Ensure ₹50 lakh cash always available for monthly salaries and expenses

## **2. Objectives of Financial Management**

> PYQ: What is financial management and their objective? (Jul-21, 15 marks)

### 2.1 Primary Objectives

**1. Profit Maximization (Traditional Objective):**

**Meaning:** Earning maximum profit from business operations.

**Example:** A company can earn ₹10 crore profit by:
- Cutting costs (using cheap raw materials)
- Increasing prices
- Reducing employee salaries

**Limitations:**

1. **Ignores Time Value of Money:**
   - ₹100 today ≠ ₹100 after 5 years (due to inflation, interest)
   - Example: Project A gives ₹10 lakh profit today, Project B gives ₹10 lakh after 5 years. Both seem equal, but Project A is better!

2. **Ignores Risk:**
   - High profit may come with high risk
   - Example: Investing in cryptocurrency may give 100% profit or 100% loss - very risky!

3. **Short-term Focus:**
   - Focus on immediate profit, ignores long-term sustainability
   - Example: Company cuts R&D budget to increase this year's profit, but loses competitiveness in future

4. **May Compromise Quality:**
   - Using cheap materials increases profit but damages brand reputation
   - Example: Using low-quality ingredients in food products to save cost

**2. Wealth Maximization (Modern Objective):**

**Meaning:** Maximizing the market value of company's shares or total wealth of shareholders.

**Formula:** Wealth = Share Price × Number of Shares

**Example:** 
- Company has 1 crore shares at ₹100 each = ₹100 crore wealth
- After good financial management, share price rises to ₹150
- New wealth = ₹150 crore (₹50 crore increase!)

**Advantages:**

1. **Considers Time Value of Money:**
   - Uses NPV (Net Present Value) to evaluate projects
   - Example: ₹10 lakh today is worth more than ₹10 lakh after 5 years

2. **Considers Risk:**
   - Balances risk and return
   - Example: Choose moderate-risk project with 15% return over high-risk project with 25% return

3. **Long-term Focus:**
   - Sustainable growth, not quick profits
   - Example: Invest in R&D, employee training for future competitiveness

4. **Shareholder Value Creation:**
   - Increases share price, benefits all shareholders
   - Example: Apple's focus on innovation increased share price from $1 to $150+ over years

**Why Wealth Maximization is Better:**

| Aspect | Profit Maximization | Wealth Maximization |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Focus** | Short-term profit | Long-term value |
| **Time Value** | Ignored | Considered |
| **Risk** | Ignored | Considered |
| **Example** | Quick profit, risky | Sustainable growth |

**Real Example:** 
- **Amazon** focused on wealth maximization - made losses for years but invested in growth. Result: Share price grew from $18 (1997) to $3,000+ (2021)
- If Amazon focused only on profit maximization, it would have remained a small bookstore

### 2.2 Other Objectives

**1. Ensuring Adequate Funds:**
- Sufficient money available when needed, no shortage
- Example: Maintain ₹10 crore working capital to pay salaries, suppliers on time

**2. Proper Utilization of Funds:**
- Use funds efficiently, no wastage, invest in profitable projects
- Example: Don't keep ₹100 crore idle in bank; invest in expansion or new products

**3. Ensuring Safety of Funds:**
- Minimize risk, protect capital from losses
- Example: Diversify investments - don't put all money in one risky project

**4. Maintaining Sound Capital Structure:**
- Right balance of debt and equity
- Example: 60% equity + 40% debt = balanced structure (not too risky, not too expensive)

---

## **3. Functions of Financial Management**

> PYQ: What is financial management and their objective? (Jul-21, 15 marks)

**1. Financial Planning:**
- Estimating fund requirements, preparing budgets for future
- Example: Plan that next year we'll need ₹50 crore for expansion - ₹30 crore from bank loan, ₹20 crore from retained earnings

**2. Financial Control:**
- Monitoring expenses, comparing actual vs planned, taking corrective action
- Example: Budget was ₹10 lakh for marketing, but spent ₹15 lakh - investigate why and control future spending

**3. Investment Decisions (Capital Budgeting):**

> PYQ: Capital Budgeting (Jul-21, 3 marks; May-23, 3 marks)

**Capital Budgeting** is evaluating and selecting long-term investment projects.

**Process:**
- Identify investment opportunities
- Evaluate using techniques (NPV, IRR, Payback Period)
- Select profitable projects
- Allocate funds

**Example:** 
Reliance has ₹10,000 crore. Should they invest in:
- **Option A:** New refinery (₹10,000 crore, 15% return)
- **Option B:** Telecom expansion (₹10,000 crore, 20% return)
- **Decision:** Choose Option B (higher return)

**Techniques:**
- **Payback Period:** How long to recover investment? (Shorter is better)
- **NPV:** Present value of future cash flows (Positive NPV = Accept)
- **IRR:** Rate of return (Higher IRR = Better)

**4. Financing Decisions:**
- How to raise funds - debt (loan) or equity (shares)
- Affects capital structure, cost of capital, risk
- Example: Need ₹100 crore - raise through ₹60 crore equity + ₹40 crore debt

**5. Dividend Decisions:**
- How much profit to distribute as dividend vs retain for growth
- Example: Earned ₹100 crore profit - pay ₹40 crore dividend (40% payout), retain ₹60 crore for expansion

**6. Working Capital Management:**

- **Working Capital = ₹50L - ₹30L = ₹20 lakh** (Good - positive working capital)

**Importance:** Ensures company can pay salaries, suppliers, bills on time

**7. Cash Management:**
- Ensuring adequate cash for daily operations
- Example: Maintain minimum ₹5 lakh cash balance always

**8. Credit Management:**
- Managing receivables (money customers owe), minimizing bad debts

### 5.1 Financial Management Decisions

> PYQ: If you are a finance manager, which type of main decisions you will take? (May-23, 15 marks)

**As a Financial Manager, key decisions:**

**1. Investment Decisions (Capital Budgeting):**

**What:** Where to invest company's funds for maximum returns

**Considerations:**
- Expected returns vs risk
- Payback period, NPV, IRR
- Alignment with business strategy

**Example Decision:**
Company has ₹500 crore. Three options:
- **Option A:** Build new factory (₹500 cr, 18% return, 5-year payback)
- **Option B:** Acquire competitor (₹500 cr, 15% return, 7-year payback)
- **Option C:** Invest in technology (₹500 cr, 25% return, 3-year payback)

**Decision:** Choose Option C (highest return, shortest payback)

**2. Financing Decisions:**

**What:** How to raise funds - debt (borrowing) or equity (ownership)

**Considerations:**
- Cost of capital (interest vs dividend)
- Tax benefits (interest is tax-deductible)
- Control (debt doesn't dilute ownership)
- Risk (high debt = high financial risk)

**Example Decision:**
Need ₹1,000 crore for expansion. Options:
- **Option A:** 100% bank loan (11% interest, tax benefit, no dilution, high risk)
- **Option B:** 100% equity (expensive, dilutes control, low risk)
- **Option C:** 60% equity + 40% debt (balanced approach)

**Decision:** Choose Option C (optimal balance of cost, risk, and control)

**3. Dividend Decisions:**

**What:** How much profit to distribute as dividend vs retain for growth

**Considerations:**
- Shareholder expectations
- Future investment needs
- Company growth stage
- Cash availability

**Example Decision:**
Earned ₹1,000 crore profit. Options:
- **Option A:** Pay 70% dividend (₹700 cr) - shareholders happy but less money for growth
- **Option B:** Pay 30% dividend (₹300 cr) - more funds for expansion but shareholders may be unhappy
- **Option C:** Pay 50% dividend (₹500 cr) - balanced approach

**Decision:** Choose Option C if company needs funds for expansion but also wants to keep shareholders satisfied

**Real Example:** 
- **Startups** (Zomato, Swiggy) pay 0% dividend - retain all profits for growth
- **Mature companies** (ITC, Hindustan Unilever) pay 50-70% dividend - stable business, less growth needs

**4. Working Capital Decisions:**

**What:** Managing day-to-day finances - cash, inventory, receivables, payables

**Considerations:**
- Maintain liquidity for operations
- Optimize inventory levels
- Balance receivables and payables
- Seasonal fluctuations

**Example Decision:**
Retail business needs to decide:
- **Cash:** Maintain ₹50 lakh minimum balance (for emergencies)
- **Inventory:** Keep 30 days stock (₹2 crore) - not too much (blocks money), not too little (stockout risk)
- **Credit Policy:** Give 30-day credit to customers, negotiate 45-day credit from suppliers
- **Result:** Positive working capital, smooth operations

**5. Risk Management Decisions:**

**What:** Identify and manage financial risks

**Types of Risks:**
- Foreign exchange risk (currency fluctuations)
- Interest rate risk (loan rates may increase)
- Credit risk (customers may not pay)
- Market risk (share prices may fall)

**Example Decision:**
Indian company imports goods worth $10 million from USA:
- **Risk:** If rupee depreciates from ₹80/$1 to ₹85/$1, cost increases by ₹5 crore
- **Options:**
  - Do nothing (risky)
  - Use forward contract to lock exchange rate (safe but costs premium)
- **Decision:** Use forward contract to hedge risk if amount is large

## **6. Capital Structure**

> PYQ: Explain the capital structure and its sources of finance. (Jul-21, 15 marks)  
> PYQ: What do you mean by capital structure? Qualities of optimum capital structure. (Jul-22, 15 marks)  
> PYQ: Capital Structures (May-23, 15 marks)

### 6.1 Meaning

> PYQ: What is the meaning of capital structure? (Jul-22, 2.5 marks)

**Capital Structure** is the mix of debt and equity used by a company to finance its operations.

**Components:**
- **Equity Capital:** Equity shares, preference shares, retained earnings
- **Debt Capital:** Debentures, bonds, long-term loans

**Example:** Company has ₹100 crore capital:
- Equity: ₹60 crore (60%)
- Debt: ₹40 crore (40%)
- **Capital Structure = 60:40**

### 6.2 Importance

**1. Maximizes Returns:**
- Optimal mix increases profitability, reduces cost of capital
- Example: Using 40% debt (cheaper) instead of 100% equity reduces overall cost from 15% to 12%

**2. Minimizes Financial Risk:**
- Balanced structure reduces risk of bankruptcy
- Example: Too much debt (90%) = high interest burden, may lead to bankruptcy if profits fall

**3. Provides Flexibility:**
- Ability to raise more funds when needed
- Example: Company with low debt (30%) can easily borrow more during expansion

**4. Maintains Control:**
- Debt doesn't dilute ownership, equity does
- Example: Promoter owns 51% shares. Taking loan maintains 51% control; issuing new shares reduces to 40%

**5. Tax Benefits:**
- Interest on debt is tax-deductible, reduces tax burden
- Example: ₹10 crore interest on loan saves ₹3 crore tax (30% tax rate)

### 6.3 Factors Affecting Capital Structure

**1. Cost of Capital:**
- Choose cheaper source to minimize cost
- Example: If loan costs 10% and equity costs 15%, prefer more debt

**2. Risk Tolerance:**
- High debt = high financial risk (must pay interest even in losses)
- Example: Risky tech startup prefers equity; stable utility company can take more debt

**3. Control Considerations:**
- Debt doesn't dilute ownership, equity does
- Example: Family-owned business prefers debt to maintain control

**4. Cash Flow Stability:**
- Debt requires regular interest payments - need stable cash flow
- Example: Real estate company with irregular cash flows prefers equity

**5. Tax Benefits:**
- Interest on debt is tax-deductible
- Example: High-profit company benefits more from debt's tax shield

**6. Market Conditions:**
- Bull market (high share prices) = good time to issue equity
- Example: Zomato issued shares during market boom at high valuation

**7. Nature of Business:**
- Stable, mature business = can take more debt
- Example: Power companies (stable) have 70% debt; IT startups (risky) have 20% debt

**8. Flexibility Needs:**
- Need for future fundraising
- Example: Company planning expansion keeps debt low now to borrow later

### 6.4 Optimum Capital Structure

> PYQ: Qualities of optimum capital structure. (Jul-22, 15 marks)

**Optimum Capital Structure** maximizes firm value while minimizing cost of capital.

**Qualities:**

**1. Maximum Returns:** Maximizes earnings per share, highest returns to shareholders

**2. Minimum Cost:** Lowest weighted average cost of capital (WACC)

**3. Minimum Risk:** Balanced financial risk, not too much debt

**4. Flexibility:** Can raise more funds when needed

**5. Control:** Maintains ownership control

**6. Tax Benefits:** Utilizes tax shield of debt

**7. Solvency:** Total assets > Total liabilities, financially sound

**Examples of Optimum Capital Structure:**

| Company Type | Typical Structure | Reason |
|--------------|------------------|---------|
| Stable Manufacturing | 50% Equity + 50% Debt | Stable cash flows support debt |
| IT Services | 70% Equity + 30% Debt | Less assets for collateral |
| Real Estate | 40% Equity + 60% Debt | Assets can be mortgaged |
| Startups | 80% Equity + 20% Debt | High risk, uncertain cash flows |

**Real Example:**
- **Reliance Industries:** 40% Debt + 60% Equity (stable, profitable, can service debt)
- **Infosys:** 90% Equity + 10% Debt (asset-light, prefers low debt)
- **Tata Steel:** 50% Debt + 50% Equity (capital-intensive, stable business)

> PYQ: Explain various sources of finance in details. (Jul-22, 15 marks)  
> PYQ: Source of Finance (May-23, 3 marks; 15 marks)

### 7.1 Internal Sources

**1. Retained Earnings (Ploughing Back of Profits):**

Profits not distributed as dividend, kept in business for reinvestment.

**Example:** Infosys earned ₹20,000 crore profit, paid ₹8,000 crore dividend, retained ₹12,000 crore for expansion.

**Advantages:**
- **No cost:** No interest or dividend payment required
- **No dilution:** Ownership control remains same
- **Readily available:** No lengthy procedures
- **Increases creditworthiness:** Strong reserves attract lenders

**Disadvantages:**
- **Limited amount:** Can't retain unlimited profits
- **Not available for new companies:** Startups have no profits yet
- **Shareholder dissatisfaction:** Investors may want higher dividends

**Best For:** Profitable, mature companies like TCS, Infosys, Reliance

**2. Depreciation Funds:**

Money set aside annually for replacing worn-out assets, can be used for other purposes meanwhile.

**Example:** Company sets aside ₹10 crore annually as depreciation; after 5 years, has ₹50 crore to replace old machinery.

**3. Sale of Assets:**

Selling unused, old, or surplus assets for quick cash.

**Example:** Company sells old factory building for ₹50 crore and uses money for expansion in new location.

### 7.2 External Sources - Long Term

**1. Equity Shares (Ordinary Shares):**

Ownership capital - shareholders are part-owners of the company.

**Example:** Zomato raised ₹9,375 crore through IPO by issuing equity shares to public in 2021.

**Advantages:**
- **No fixed obligation:** Pay dividend only when company makes profit
- **Permanent capital:** Never needs to be repaid
- **No charge on assets:** Assets remain free for other borrowings
- **Voting rights:** Shareholders participate in major decisions
- **Increases creditworthiness:** Strong equity base attracts lenders

**Disadvantages:**
- **Dilutes control:** More shareholders = less control for promoters
- **Expensive:** Dividend not tax-deductible, flotation costs high
- **Complex procedures:** SEBI regulations, stock exchange listing requirements
- **Profit sharing:** Must share profits with more people

**Best For:** Startups, high-growth companies, companies wanting permanent capital

**2. Preference Shares:**

Hybrid security - features of both equity and debt. Get fixed dividend and preference in payment.

**Example:** Company issues 10% preference shares of ₹100 crore - must pay ₹10 crore dividend annually before paying equity shareholders.

**Advantages:**
- **No dilution of control:** Preference shareholders usually don't have voting rights
- **Fixed dividend rate:** Predictable cost (e.g., 10% annually)
- **No charge on assets:** Assets remain free

**Disadvantages:**
- **Dividend not tax-deductible:** Unlike interest on debt
- **Fixed burden:** Must pay even if profits are low
- **Cumulative liability:** If dividend not paid, it accumulates

**Best For:** Companies wanting capital without diluting control

**3. Debentures/Bonds:**

Long-term borrowing from public, fixed interest rate, must be repaid after maturity.

**Example:** Reliance issued ₹10,000 crore bonds at 8% interest for 10 years - must pay ₹800 crore interest annually and repay ₹10,000 crore after 10 years.

**Advantages:**
- **Interest is tax-deductible:** Saves tax (e.g., ₹800 cr interest saves ₹240 cr tax at 30%)
- **No dilution of control:** Debenture holders are creditors, not owners
- **Cheaper than equity:** Interest (8-10%) < Dividend (12-15%)
- **Trading on equity:** Use borrowed money to earn higher returns

**Disadvantages:**
- **Fixed obligation:** Must pay interest even in losses
- **Charge on assets:** Assets mortgaged as security
- **Increases financial risk:** High debt = risk of bankruptcy
- **Must be repaid:** Unlike equity, debentures have maturity date

**Best For:** Profitable companies with stable cash flows, capital-intensive industries

**4. Term Loans (Bank Loans):**

Long-term loans from banks/financial institutions for 5-10 years.

**Example:** Tata Motors took ₹5,000 crore term loan from SBI at 10% interest for 7 years to build new plant.

**Advantages:**

**Disadvantages:**
- **Fixed obligation:** Must pay EMI regularly
- **Security required:** Must pledge assets as collateral
- **Restrictive covenants:** Bank may impose conditions (maintain certain ratios, no dividends above limit)
- **Processing time:** Takes 2-3 months for approval

**Best For:** Established companies with assets to pledge, stable cash flows

**5. Venture Capital:**

Funding for startups and high-risk, high-growth companies by specialized investors.

- **Expertise and guidance:** VCs provide mentorship, network, strategic advice
- **No repayment burden:** Not a loan, it's equity investment
- **Credibility:** VC backing attracts more investors

**Disadvantages:**
- **Dilution of control:** VCs take 20-40% ownership, board seats
- **Share profits:** Must share future profits and exit gains
- **Exit pressure:** VCs want exit (IPO/sale) in 5-7 years
- **Stringent terms:** Performance milestones, anti-dilution clauses

**Best For:** Tech startups, innovative businesses with high growth potential but no profits yet

**Famous VCs in India:** Sequoia Capital, Accel Partners, Tiger Global, SoftBank

### 7.3 External Sources - Short Term

**Advantages:** 
- Cheaper than bank loan (7-8% vs 11-12%)
- No security needed
- Quick fundraising

**Disadvantages:** 
- Only for large, creditworthy companies (minimum ₹5 crore)
- Short-term only
- Market dependent

**4. Factoring:**

Selling accounts receivable (customer dues) to factor company for immediate cash at discount.
