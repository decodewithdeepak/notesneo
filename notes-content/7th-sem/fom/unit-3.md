## **1. Marketing Management**

> PYQ: What is the difference between Marketing and Selling? Explain all concepts of marketing. (Jul-21, 15 marks)  
> PYQ: Characterise the marketing management and also define its functions. What is the importance of marketing management and market research? (May-23, 15 marks)

### 1.1 Definition of Marketing

**Marketing** is the process of identifying customer needs, creating products to satisfy those needs, and delivering them to customers at the right price, place, and time while making profit.

**Philip Kotler:** "Marketing is a social and managerial process by which individuals and groups obtain what they need and want through creating, offering and exchanging products of value with others."

**In Simple Words:** Marketing is understanding what customers want and giving it to them better than competitors.

**Example:** Zomato identified that people want food delivered quickly at home. They created an app, partnered with restaurants, set reasonable prices, and delivered food within 30 minutes. This entire process is marketing.

**Note:** Marketing ≠ Advertising. Advertising is just ONE tool in marketing. Marketing includes research, product design, pricing, distribution, promotion (which includes advertising), and customer service.

**4Ps of Marketing (Marketing Mix):**
1. Product - What to sell
2. Price - At what price to sell
3. Place - Where to sell
4. Promotion - How to sell

### 1.2 Marketing vs Selling

> PYQ: What is the difference between Marketing and Selling? Explain all concepts of marketing. (Jul-21, 15 marks)

| Aspect              | Marketing                                                  | Selling                              |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Core Focus**      | Satisfying customer needs and wants                        | Selling what is already produced     |
| **Primary Aim**     | Build long-term customer relationships & loyalty           | Maximize immediate sales             |
| **Orientation**     | Outside-in: start from customer, design product backwards  | Inside-out: start from product, find buyers |
| **Approach**        | Pull: attract customers by meeting their needs             | Push: persuade/bargain customers to buy |
| **Process Start**   | Research market/customer first                             | Begin with product or factory output |
| **Scope**           | Broad: product design, pricing, promotion, distribution    | Narrow: only selling & promotion     |
| **Timeline**        | Long-term (brand & loyalty)                                | Short-term (quick results)           |
| **Philosophy**      | "Make what you can sell"                                   | "Sell what you make"                 |
| **Example**         | Identify gaps, create innovative products, build relationships | Produce goods, use aggressive selling tactics |

**Detailed Example:**

**Marketing Approach - Swiggy:**
1. **Started with customer:** Researched that people want food delivered quickly at home
2. **Identified need:** Convenience, variety, fast delivery
3. **Created solution:** Built app connecting restaurants and customers
4. **Customer-focused:** Live tracking, multiple payment options, customer support
5. **Long-term:** Built loyalty through Swiggy One membership, personalized recommendations
6. **Result:** Customers willingly use Swiggy because it solves their problem

**Selling Approach - Traditional Door-to-Door Salesman:**
1. **Started with product:** Company made vacuum cleaners
2. **Find buyers:** Go door-to-door to find anyone who might buy
3. **Aggressive tactics:** Demonstrate product, offer discounts, create urgency ("offer valid today only")
4. **Product-focused:** Focus on features, not whether customer actually needs it
5. **Short-term:** Make the sale, move to next customer
6. **Result:** Customer may buy due to pressure, but may not be satisfied or return

**Key Difference:** 
- **Marketing (Swiggy)** = Customer pulled towards product because it meets their need
- **Selling (Salesman)** = Product pushed onto customer through persuasion 

### 1.3 Marketing Concepts

> PYQ: Explain all concepts of marketing. (Jul-21, 15 marks)

**1. Production Concept (Before 1930s):**

**Philosophy:** "Customers prefer affordable and easily available products"

**Focus:** Mass production at low cost, wide distribution

**When Used:** When demand exceeds supply

**Example:** Henry Ford's Model T - "Any color as long as it's black." Mass production made cars affordable (₹850 to ₹260). Customers bought because cars were scarce and cheap.

**2. Product Concept (1930s-1950s):**

**Philosophy:** "Customers prefer products with best quality and features"

**Focus:** Superior product quality, innovation, performance

**Limitation:** Marketing Myopia - Companies focus so much on product that they ignore what customers actually want.

**Example:** Kodak made excellent cameras but ignored digital photography. Result: Bankruptcy. They focused on product perfection, not customer needs.

**3. Selling Concept (1950s-1960s):**

**Philosophy:** "Customers won't buy unless we push them"

**Focus:** Aggressive selling, heavy advertising, promotions

**When Used:** For unsought goods (insurance, encyclopedias)

**Example:** Insurance agents aggressively convincing people to buy policies. Credit card companies calling repeatedly to sell cards.

**4. Marketing Concept (1960s-1980s):**

**Philosophy:** "Customer is king. Find needs and fulfill them"

**Focus:** Customer research, understand needs, then create products

**Example:** Amul researched that Indians want affordable, quality milk products. They created cooperative model, ensured quality, and reasonable prices. Result: India's most loved brand.

**5. Societal Marketing Concept (1980s onwards):**

**Philosophy:** "Satisfy customers + Protect society and environment"

**Focus:** Customer needs + Social welfare + Environmental protection

**Example:** 
- Patagonia (clothing brand) uses recycled materials, donates 1% revenue to environment
- ITC's eco-friendly hotels, paperboards from waste
- Tesla's electric cars - satisfy customers while reducing pollution
